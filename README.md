## üéØ Overview

**KPC (Kernel Process Control)** is a sophisticated Windows security tool designed for **security researchers**, **digital forensics investigators**, and **system administrators** who require authoritative control over the Windows environment at the kernel level.

This tool represents a synthesis of deep Windows internal knowledge, innovative software engineering, and practical security expertise. It respects the rules of the modern Windows security environment while providing the necessary tools to legitimately analyze and interact with it at the highest levels of trust.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**KPC operates at Windows kernel level with elevated privileges.** This is not a tool for casual use but is intended for professionals who understand the implications of kernel-level operations and have legitimate security research or forensic analysis needs.

### Memory Forensics Operations

![Memory Dumping Demo](docs/images/Screen02.jpg)

```bash
# Create full memory dump of LSASS process
kpc.exe dump lsass C:\Evidence\

# Dump specific process by PID
kpc.exe dump 1234

# Dump process by name to default Downloads folder
kpc.exe dump MsMpEng.exe
```

### Process Protection Analysis

![Protected Processes List](docs/images/Screen03.jpg)

```bash
# Display all protected processes with detailed information
kpc.exe list

# Get protection status of specific process
kpc.exe info lsass

# Get detailed process information including dumpability analysis
kpc.exe info 1234
```

### Protection Manipulation
```bash
# Remove PPL protection from LSASS
kpc.exe unprotect lsass

# Grant Antimalware-level protection to custom application
kpc.exe protect MyApp.exe PPL Antimalware

# Strip protection from ALL protected processes (powerful!)
kpc.exe unprotect all

# Batch unprotection of multiple targets
kpc.exe unprotect "1234,5678,lsass,MsMpEng"
```

### System Integration & Privilege Escalation
```bash
# Launch Command Prompt with full TrustedInstaller privileges
kpc.exe trusted cmd.exe

# Execute PowerShell with maximum system privileges
kpc.exe trusted powershell.exe

# Run application with elevated privileges
kpc.exe trusted "C:\MyApp.exe" --arguments

# Install context menu entries for right-click access
kpc.exe install-context

# Add KPC to Windows Defender exclusions
kpc.exe add-exclusion
```

## üèÜ TrustedInstaller Privileges

When using `kpc.exe trusted`, the following **25+ Windows privileges** are automatically enabled:

| Privilege Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `SeLockMemoryPrivilege` | Lock pages in memory |
| `SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege` | Increase process quotas |
| `SeSecurityPrivilege` | Manage security and audit logs |
| `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` | Take ownership of files/objects |
| `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` | Load and unload device drivers |
| `SeSystemProfilePrivilege` | Profile system performance |
| `SeSystemtimePrivilege` | Change system time |
| `SeProfileSingleProcessPrivilege` | Profile single process |
| `SeIncreaseBasePriorityPrivilege` | Increase scheduling priority |
| `SeCreatePagefilePrivilege` | Create page files |
| `SeBackupPrivilege` | Backup files and directories |
| `SeRestorePrivilege` | Restore files and directories |
| `SeShutdownPrivilege` | Shut down the system |
| `SeDebugPrivilege` | Debug processes |
| `SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege` | Modify system environment |
| `SeChangeNotifyPrivilege` | Bypass traverse checking |
| `SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege` | Remote system shutdown |
| `SeUndockPrivilege` | Remove from docking station |
| `SeManageVolumePrivilege` | Manage volume and disk quotas |
| `SeImpersonatePrivilege` | Impersonate client after auth |
| `SeCreateGlobalPrivilege` | Create global objects |
| `SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege` | Increase working set |
| `SeTimeZonePrivilege` | Change time zone |
| `SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege` | Create symbolic links |
| `SeDelegateSessionUserImpersonatePrivilege` | Delegate session user impersonation |

This represents **maximum possible system access** - equivalent to running as the Windows kernel itself.

## üîí Security Architecture & Steganography

### Advanced Protection Mechanisms

KPC employs several sophisticated techniques to avoid detection and prevent abuse:

#### üé≠ **Steganographic Driver Embedding**
- The kernel driver is **embedded within the icon resource** (`kpc.ico`) using steganographic techniques
- Driver data is **XOR encrypted** and hidden after legitimate icon data (offset +9662 bytes)
- **Runtime extraction and decryption** ensures the driver never exists as a standalone file
- **Automatic cleanup** removes all traces after operation completion

#### üîê **Multi-Layer Obfuscation**
- **String obfuscation** using compile-time XOR encryption (`OBFSTR`, `OBFAPI` macros)
- **Dynamic API loading** to avoid static import analysis
- **Anti-analysis delays** and fake registry operations to confuse behavioral detection
- **Process hollowing detection** countermeasures

#### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Through Obscurity**
The XOR decryption key in `Controller.cpp` has been **intentionally redacted**:
```cpp
// Obfuscated decryption key to avoid static analysis
auto decryptionKey = OBFSTR("[REDACTED]");
```

This design decision serves multiple purposes:
- **Prevents script kiddie abuse** - 95% of casual users will get non-functional binaries
- **Educational compilation** - program runs but performs no actual operations without correct key
- **Professional access control** - legitimate security researchers can request the key
- **Malware prevention** - reduces risk of KPC being incorporated into malicious software

---

## üîß Compilation Instructions

### Build Requirements
- **Visual Studio 2022** with C++20/Latest support
- **Windows SDK 10.0** or later
- **Administrator privileges** for kernel driver operations

### Compilation Process
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wesmar/kpc.git
cd kpc
# Open Kpc.vcxproj in Visual Studio
# Build in Release/x64 configuration
```

### Build Configuration Details
The project uses several advanced compilation flags:
- **`/Brepro`** - Reproducible builds with deterministic timestamps
- **`/GS-`** - Stack security checks disabled for performance
- **`/MERGE:.rdata=.text`** - Section merging for smaller binaries
- **Timestamp masking** - Binary appears to be compiled on August 31, 2025
- **Version spoofing** - Mimics Windows system file version `10.0.26100.5770`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Compilation Warning
**Without the correct XOR decryption key, the compiled binary will:**
- ‚úÖ Execute successfully and display help information
- ‚úÖ Provide educational value for understanding Windows internals
- ‚ùå **NOT perform any actual kernel operations** (driver extraction fails)
- ‚ùå All protection bypass and dumping features will be non-functional

**The entire tool's functionality depends on a single correct decryption string.**

### Professional Access
The complete source code with functional decryption key can be provided to:
- **Established security researchers** with verifiable academic or professional credentials
- **Digital forensics professionals** working for legitimate law enforcement or corporate security
- **Individuals with demonstrated high social trust** and commitment to ethical use

**Requests should include:**
- Professional background and credentials
- Intended use case and research objectives  
- Assurance of ethical use (no malware development)
